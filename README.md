How the Program Works
# Login Functionality:

The program starts by asking for the account number and PIN.
1 If the credentials match the predefined account number and PIN, the user is logged in.
2 If the credentials are incorrect, the user is prompted to try again.

# Main Menu:

Once logged in, the user is presented with a menu of options:

1 .Check Balance: Displays the current balance.
2 .Withdraw Cash: Allows the user to withdraw a specified amount from the balance.
3 .Deposit Cash: Allows the user to deposit a specified amount into the balance.
4 .Change PIN: Allows the user to change their PIN.
5 .Logout: Logs the user out and returns them to the login prompt.

# Operations:

Deposit Cash: Adds the specified amount to the balance.
Change PIN: Updates the user's PIN.
Logout: Logs the user out, requiring them to log in again to perform further operations.
